The standard story goes that there are three formulations of fundamnetal quantum mechanics.
- Schr√∂dinder picture, phsyical things are time-evolving Hilbert space vectors.
- Heisenberg picture, physical things are time-evolving operators acting on some initial condition.
- Feynman picture, physical things are propagators $$K(\boldsymbol{x}\gets \boldsymbol{y}) $$, in which $$\boldsymbol{x}, \boldsymbol{y}$$ are collections of classical states.
