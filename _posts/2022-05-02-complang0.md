# Introduction

C++, along with vanilla C and Fortran, are the dominant languages of high-performance computing.
Unlike C/Fortran though, it remains popular in the software engineering community, leading to many
headaches when searching the internet for advice. A line should be drawn between the requirements of the tech industry and the requirements of
science: many behaviours that would be unthinkable in
production code are completely fine for scientific code that runs once.

The requirements to be balanced are
1. Write code that is _verifiably correct_.
2. Write code that is _fast_, or at least _not unduly inefficient_.
3. Finish the project in a reasonable amount of time.

# Build systems

## GNU make
This is a tried-and-tested tool for building projects. Like much in the GNU ecosystem, it's an...
eccentric piece of software with a learning curve strongly resembling a cliff. I will not attempt to
explain it, as there are [already](https://makefiletutorial.com/)
[several](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2481269/how-to-make-a-simple-c-makefile/2481326#2481326)
[attempts](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/) 
on the internet.

I will leave here my own general-purpose "just make it work" makefile (modified from Atilla Szabo's
makefile, and plagiarised from countless forgotten stackoverflow users).

This file expects your directory structure to look something like

```
myProject/src + Makefile
              + source1.cc
			  + source2.cc
			  + struct ----- + struct1.hh
			                 + struct2.hh
							 + struct3.hh
```

Note that this makefile traverses all levels of subfolders, which in principle could lead to some
nasty behaviour if you have done some funny business with symlinks.

## `cmake`

is probably not worth your time to learn unless you plan to become a software engineer / distribute
your code widely.



# Documentation

By default, the C/C++ extension to VS code recognises "javadoc style" function annotations:

```
/**
* @brief Runs a full Monte Carlo sweep
* 
* Performs 1 round of gauge shuffling, then n Ising MC steps
* 
* @param T Tmeperature
* @param sweep Number of Ising MC steps
* @param method_Sz Bit flag for Ising flip strategy. may be
*                  - MC_NONE for no flips
*                  - MC_SMALL for Metropolis by plaquette
*                  - MC_FREEZE to flip only if energy is strictly smaller
* @param method_angle Bit flag for angular relaxation strategy.
*                  - MC_NONE for no relaxation
*                  - MC_LARGE for von Mises sampled gradient descent
*                  - MC_SMALL for uniform MC gradient descent
*                  - MC_FREEZE for MC at zero temperature
* @param sampling  Bit flag for order to do MC steps in
*                  - MC_SEQ to go through all sites in order
*                  - MC_RANDOM to visit random sites
*/
void MC(double T, unsigned sweep, unsigned method_Sz = MC_SMALL,
            unsigned method_angle = MC_LARGE, unsigned sampling = MC_SEQ);
```

In an IDE, this gives you hover-tips:

Further, the tool [Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/) can read these annotations and produce a
searchable HTML webpage documenting your code. In practice, this does not tend to be the most
readable thing on the planet, but it's better than no documentation.
