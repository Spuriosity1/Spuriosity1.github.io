# Introduction

C++, along with vanilla C and Fortran, are the dominant languages of high-performance computing.
Unlike C/Fortran though, it remains popular in the software engineering community, leading to many
headaches when searching the internet for advice. A line should be drawn between the requirements of the tech industry and the requirements of
science: many behaviours that would be unthinkable in production code are completely fine for scientific code that runs once.

The non-negotiable requirements are
1. Write code that is _verifiably correct_.
2. Write code that is _fast_, or at least _not unduly inefficient_.
3. Finish the project in a reasonable amount of time.

The nice-to-haves are
1. Make the code easy to read for another person.
2. Make the code easy to use.
3. Make the code easy to install.

# Build systems

## Just writing a shell script
A fair number of science codes are simple enough that a file called `comile.sh`, reading
`g++ -o best_science src1.cc src2.cc src3.cc -I/path/to/library`
is good enough. The price you pay here is that a) 

## GNU make
This is a tried-and-tested tool for building projects. Like much in the GNU ecosystem, it's an...
eccentric piece of software with a learning curve strongly resembling a cliff. I will not attempt to
explain it, as there are [already](https://makefiletutorial.com/)
[several](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2481269/how-to-make-a-simple-c-makefile/2481326#2481326)
[attempts](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/) 
on the internet.

I will leave here my own makefile (partially copied from Atilla Szabó's
makefile, and partially plagiarised from stackoverflow).

This file expects your directory structure to look something like

```
myProject/src + Makefile
              + source1.cc
			  + source2.cc
			  + struct ----- + struct1.hh
							 + struct1.cc
			                 + struct2.hh
			                 + struct2.cc
```

Note that this makefile traverses all levels of subfolders, which in principle could lead to some
nasty behaviour if you have done some funny business with symlinks.

## `cmake`, `meson`

are probably not worth your time to learn unless you plan to become a software engineer / distribute
your code widely.




# Documentation

By default, the C/C++ extension to VS code recognises "javadoc style" function annotations:

```
/**
* @brief Runs a full Monte Carlo sweep
* 
* Performs 1 round of gauge shuffling, then n Ising MC steps
* 
* @param T Tmeperature
* @param sweep Number of Ising MC steps
* @param method_Sz Bit flag for Ising flip strategy. may be
*                  - MC_NONE for no flips
*                  - MC_SMALL for Metropolis by plaquette
*                  - MC_FREEZE to flip only if energy is strictly smaller
* @param method_angle Bit flag for angular relaxation strategy.
*                  - MC_NONE for no relaxation
*                  - MC_LARGE for von Mises sampled gradient descent
*                  - MC_SMALL for uniform MC gradient descent
*                  - MC_FREEZE for MC at zero temperature
* @param sampling  Bit flag for order to do MC steps in
*                  - MC_SEQ to go through all sites in order
*                  - MC_RANDOM to visit random sites
*/
void MC(double T, unsigned sweep, unsigned method_Sz = MC_SMALL,
            unsigned method_angle = MC_LARGE, unsigned sampling = MC_SEQ);
```

In an IDE, this gives you hover-tips:

Further, the tool [Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/) can read these annotations and produce a
searchable HTML webpage documenting your code. In practice, this does not tend to be the most
readable thing on the planet, but it's better than no documentation.
