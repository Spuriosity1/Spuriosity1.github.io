This is a tried-and-tested tool for building projects. It's _horribly_ docmented though




# Documentation

By default, the C/C++ extension to VS code recognises "javadoc style" function annotations:

```
/**
* @brief Runs a full Monte Carlo sweep
* 
* Performs 1 round of gauge shuffling, then n Ising MC steps
* 
* @param T Tmeperature
* @param sweep Number of Ising MC steps
* @param method_Sz Bit flag for Ising flip strategy. may be
*                  - MC_NONE for no flips
*                  - MC_SMALL for Metropolis by plaquette
*                  - MC_FREEZE to flip only if energy is strictly smaller
* @param method_angle Bit flag for angular relaxation strategy.
*                  - MC_NONE for no relaxation
*                  - MC_LARGE for von Mises sampled gradient descent
*                  - MC_SMALL for uniform MC gradient descent
*                  - MC_FREEZE for MC at zero temperature
* @param sampling  Bit flag for order to do MC steps in

void MC(double T, unsigned sweep, unsigned method_Sz = MC_SMALL,
            unsigned method_angle = MC_LARGE, unsigned sampling = MC_SEQ);
```

In an IDE, this gives you hover-tips:
