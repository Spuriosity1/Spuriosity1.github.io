![Pain de Gluten](../assets/paindegluten.jpg)

It is about time that I embrace my repressed personality as an early 90's blogger venting his
frustrations to the world on a blog nobody reads. 
As a lifelong sufferer of coeliac disease (_la maladie coeliaque_), I had always assumed that travel to France was
virtually impossible due to the pervasive use of wheat flour - from the breakfast pastries to the
_roux_ at the base of most sauces and soups, French cooking has had a lifelong love affair with the
forbidden grain. Though it's certainly not trivial, an extended stay in Paris as a strict coeliac is
certainly possible without resorting to a stash of bananas and crackers every time eating out comes
to mind. The prevalence of coeliac disease in Europe is currently
[estimated](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29551598/) to be around 0.8%, suggesting that a
restaurant feeding an average of 100 patrons a night has a 99.6% chance (\*) of seeing at least one
coeliac every week.

Many of the airy blog posts below paint an airy picture of a gluten free revolution in Paris,
but this is not really my experience. There are a _few_ places, but if you have come here hoping to
experience all of French cuisine in a format tolerable by your guts, you will be disappointed.
Going out spontaneously with friends is more of a challenge than in e.g. Edinburgh, Rome, Florence.

# Methodology

\* Assuming that all restaurantgoers are European and coeliacs eat out as often as non-coeliacs
(likely not true, but most restaurants are open for longer than one week)

Googling "Gluten Free Paris" is certainly responsible for some hits here, but I also switched Google's
language to French and searched "boulangerie sans gluten". I've added links to all sources that
recommended a given place,but crucially, you should not necessarily interpret more referring links as
consensus.

I've saved all of the places I could find that were still open to [this Google
list](https://goo.gl/maps/QBgjDixy6AK7jmXX6)


I'm just compiling a list here, so the descriptions will generally be quite spartan.

# Glossary

Most Parisians unfortunate enough to staff service industry jobs in the tourist precincts of the
city speak flawless English, but nonetheless it's helpful to know all of the danger terms in French
for label-reading, lapses in vocabulary and other similar endeavours

# Quick bites

**Maccas**

It's Macdonalds.

They only fry potatoes;

they're gluten free.


**La Guinguette d’Angèle**

Takeaway-only quick bite, with vegan options as well. [2]




#The supermarket

After some searching, I found a packet of five (why five?) slices of Schär gluten free bread and a packet of sweet biscuits available at a
Carefour express. Not all Carefours carry it though.

**Meat and Cheese** 




# Hotels

**French Theory**

I stayed here. They have a small, but fit for purpose breakfast menu in the cafe downstairs
with several GF options. Hipster vibes.



# Pâtisserie and similar

**Helmut New Cake**

Friands, Tarts and baguettes. [1, 3]


**Maison Plume**

Primarily focussed on absolutely exquisite, finely crafted desserts. [1]

**Yummy and Guiltfree**

Maybe it's just me, but I get a weird vibe from food that describes itself as "guilt free". Eat the
damn pastry and enjoy it. Maybe there will be cause for regret later, as I nurse a swollen belly,
but starting a meal with a passive-aggressive reminder that I should be watching what I eat puts a
bad taste in my mouth. If this place is 

Pontification aside, this is a popular joint for _croque monsuieur_ and a variety of sweet waffles
and ice cream. [1, 3, 4, 5]


**La Meringaie**

All things meringue based- macarons, pavlovas, and little meringue drops (meringuettes). This is a
chain, with 5 stores at time of writing. [1]



# Boulangerie

**Copains**

Cinnamon rolls, cookies and breads that are light and airy, with a proper crunchy crust. [5]


**NoGlu**

Purveyors of glazed doughnuts, baguettes and  Though they open at 8:30, they don't have croissants until 9:30. Try to
get in relatively early - by 18:00, they only have a few things left. I tried their éclairs and
zucchini quiche, both of which were delightful nonetheless. [1, 2]

**La belle vie sans gluten - Clementine Oliver**

A master bread baker. Baguettes, whole loaves, scones and a small collection of sweet cakes. A bit
out of the way, but you can order online! [1]

**Boulangerie Chambelland**

Loaves, crackers, focaccia, cakes, patisserie and éclairs. [1]


**Maison Kayser / Boulangerie Eric Kayser**

A huge international chain of bakeries. These have a "gluten free corner"
consisting of a few loaves of bread and cookies. I did not add these to the map. [2]


# Café and Lunch

**Adam & Eve Café**

Worthy "clean eating" type place. [2]


**Twinkie Breakfast & Lunch**
All day brunch - pancakes, egg on toast etc. A tourist-focussed place, "Breakfast" and "Lunch" signs
are written in English. (probably still better than par for London tbh) [2]



# Lunch & Dinner

**Breizh Café**

I found this place almost by accident, and it's fantastic. It's a Crêperie serving
gluten free buckwheat Galettes with either traditional French fillings (egg, ham, cheese) or some
light Japanese fusion (shiitake mushroom with wakame, lobster with yuzu, pastrami with an Asian
pickle). Wash it down with a glass of their excellent Breton cider for an immensely satisfying meal. 

Reassuringly popular with locals.

**L'Osteria Ruggera**

Gluten free menu. Pizzas are prepared the day before, so order at least a day in advance. Pizzas are
cooked in the same oven as normal, so cross contamination is a possibility.
[2]

**Gemini**

A chain of mid-range Italian restaurants. The menu will not exactly surprise you - pasta nd pizza. They can use gluten free pasta, and offer gluten free pizza bases (with a d"may contain traces" disclaimer). Tourist vibes: it has a kids' menu. [2]

**Little Nonna**

A dedicated gluten free Italian restaurant.

**Nous**

A chain of fun, fresh looking foods.

**Soya cantine Bio**

As worthy as it sounds.

# Ice cream

**Grom** has gluten free cones.

Note that some of these are out of date. Parisian restaurants drop like flies at the best of times,
and covid certainly didn't help. These are not in any order.
