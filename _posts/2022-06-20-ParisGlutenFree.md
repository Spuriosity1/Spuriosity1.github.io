![Pain de Gluten](../assets/paindegluten.jpg)

It is about time that I embrace my repressed personality as an early 90's blogger venting his
frustrations to the world on a blog nobody reads. 
As a lifelong sufferer of coeliac disease (_la maladie coeliaque_), I had always assumed that travel to France was
virtually impossible due to the pervasive use of wheat flour - from the breakfast pastries to the
_roux_ at the base of most sauces and soups, French cooking has had a lifelong love affair with the
forbidden grain. Though it's certainly not trivial, an extended stay in Paris as a strict coeliac is
certainly possible without resorting to a stash of bananas and crackers every time eating out comes
to mind. The prevalence of coeliac disease in Europe is currently
[estimated](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29551598/) to be around 0.8%, suggesting that a
restaurant feeding an average of 100 patrons a night has a 99.6% chance (\*) of seeing at least one
coeliac every week.

Many of the blog posts below paint a rosy picture of a gluten free revolution in Paris,
but this is not really my experience. There are a _few_ places, but if you have come here hoping to
experience all of French cuisine in a format tolerable by your guts, you will be disappointed.
Going out spontaneously with friends is more of a challenge than in e.g. Edinburgh, Rome, Florence.


<span style="font-size: 10pt">
(\*) Assuming that all restaurantgoers are European and coeliacs eat out as often as
non-coeliacs. This assumption is false - [one
survey](https://because-gus.com/les-resultats-du-barometre-sans-gluten-2022/)
suggested that 80% of French coeliacs limit their trips to restaurants.

# Methodology

The author entered the search terms from the following list into the _DuckDuckGo_ web search engine,
with search localisation set to France.

- gluten free Paris 
- Paris "sans gluten" 
- sans gluten 
- boulangerie sans gluten 

Of the sources listed in the bibliography, those which remain open were saved to [a Google Maps
list](https://goo.gl/maps/QBgjDixy6AK7jmXX6) for convenience.


I'm just compiling a list here, so the descriptions will generally be quite spartan.

# Glossary

Most Parisians unfortunate enough to staff service industry jobs in the tourist precincts of the
city speak flawless English, but nonetheless it's helpful to know all of the danger terms in French
for label-reading, lapses in vocabulary and other similar endeavours

| gluten free (gf) | sans gluten (sg) |
| wheat  | blé    |
| barley | orge   |
| rye    | seigle |
| spelt  | épautre |
| oats   | avoine |
| dextrose | dextrose |
| thickener | épaississant |
| May contain traces of gluten | Poit contenir des traces de gluten |

# Quick bites

**La Guinguette d’Angèle**

Takeaway-only quick bite, with vegan options as well. [2]

**Judy**

Nice food in a box to take away and eat in the sun. [5]


# The supermarket

After some searching, I found a packet of five (why five?) slices of Schär gluten free bread and a packet of sweet biscuits available at a
Carefour express. Not all Carefours carry it though.

**Meat and Cheese** 

Proscuitto made in the traditional way is _technically_ not entirely gluten free. When the pork leg
is salted and hung out to dry, the cut surface is covered with a wheat dough to stop it drying out
to fast and keep the meat soft. If you get a part of this surface in the finished product, there is
a low but nonzero chance of contamination. I've personally never had problems with flagrantly
ignoring this fact though - the flour paste is usually thoroughly washed or cut off by the time it
is sold in a packet. To be extra safe, it's advisable to cut or peel off the outermost surface of
the meat.

Wheat is not involved in the ham-making process as far as I'm aware.

_TODO: review of common ham / bacon brands_



# Hotels

**French Theory**

I stayed here. They have a small breakfast menu in the cafe downstairs
with several GF options. Hipster vibes.


# Crêperies

These are your best bet in terms of capital 'F' French food that is 'intrinsically' gluten free, since buckwheat
galettes traditionally contain no wheat flour.


**Breizh Café**

I found this place almost by accident, and it's fantastic. It's a Crêperie serving
gluten free buckwheat Galettes with either traditional French fillings (egg, ham, cheese) or some
light Japanese fusion (shiitake mushroom with wakame, lobster with yuzu, pastrami with an Asian
pickle). Wash it down with a glass of their excellent Breton cider for an immensely satisfying meal. 

Reassuringly popular with locals. [5, self]


**La Petite Bouclerie**

A tiny crêperie in the Quarter Latin, very near Notre Dame and Sainte-Chapelle. They can do all of
their sweet and savoury crêpes on buckwheat galettes. This is a very useful place to know about for
a casual meal with friends. 'Sans gluten' is advertised on their signs, 
[5, self]

**Caramel Sarrasin**

[5]

**La Crêperie de Josselin**

[5]

# Pâtisserie and similar

**Helmut New Cake**

Friands, Tarts and baguettes. [1, 3]


**Maison Plume**

Primarily focussed on absolutely exquisite, finely crafted desserts. [1]

**Yummy and Guiltfree**

Maybe it's just me, but I get a weird vibe from food that describes itself as "guilt free". Eat the
damn pastry and enjoy it. Maybe there will be cause for regret later, as I nurse a swollen belly,
but starting a meal with a passive-aggressive reminder that I should be watching what I eat puts a
bad taste in my mouth. If this place is 

Pontification aside, this is a popular joint for _croque monsuieur_ and a variety of sweet waffles
and ice cream. [1, 3, 4, 5]


**La Meringaie**

All things meringue based- macarons, pavlovas, and little meringue drops (meringuettes). This is a
chain, with 5 stores at time of writing. [1]

**Maison Georges Larnicol**

Chain of sweet chops doing chocolates and gluten free macarons. [5]

# Boulangerie

**Copains**

Cinnamon rolls, cookies and breads that are light and airy, with a proper crunchy crust. [5]

**NoGlu**

Purveyors of glazed doughnuts, baguettes and pastry. Though they open at 8:30, they don't have croissants until 9:30. Try to
get in relatively early - by 18:00, they only have a few things left. They serve croque monsieur ans similar up to 16:00.
I tried their éclairs and zucchini quiche, both of which were delightful nonetheless. [1, 2, self]

**La belle vie sans gluten - Clementine Oliver**

A master bread baker. Baguettes, whole loaves, scones and a small collection of sweet cakes. A bit
out of the way, but you can order online! [1]

**Boulangerie Chambelland**

Loaves, crackers, focaccia, cakes, patisserie and éclairs. [1]


**Maison Kayser / Boulangerie Eric Kayser**

A huge international chain of bakeries. These have a "gluten free corner"
consisting of a few loaves of bread and cookies. I did not add these to the map. [2]


# Café and Lunch

Note that locals will typically have a very light breakfast, e.g. granola or coffe and a pastry,
rather than sitting down to a full smashed avocado toast + egg as is typical in anglophone countries.
Due to the tourist trade, this makes big-breakfast serving places _more_ likely to have a
GF option.

**Adam & Eve Café**

Worthy "clean eating" type place. [2]


**Twinkie Breakfast & Lunch**

All day brunch - pancakes, egg on toast etc. A tourist-focussed place, "Breakfast" and "Lunch" signs
are written in English. [2]

# Lunch & Dinner


## Italian Restaurants

You probably didn't come to Paris for this, but as far as I can tell, a lot of the best 100% gluten free places in Paris comes in the form of Italian food.

**L'Osteria Ruggera**

Gluten free menu. Pizzas are prepared the day before, so order at least a day in advance. Pizzas are
cooked in the same oven as normal, so cross contamination is a possibility.
[2]

**Gemini**

A chain of mid-range Italian restaurants.
They can use gluten free pasta, and offer gluten free pizza bases (with a "may contain traces" disclaimer). 
Useful to know about if you need a place to eat, but probably not a destination in its own right. [2]

**Little Nonna**

A dedicated gluten free Italian restaurant. [2, 6]

**Manicaretti**

100% gluten free. Fresh salads, pasta, arancini - all the good stuff. [6]

**Alla Mano**

"In hand". A 100% gluten free place, run by the people behind Manicaretti. Selection of hand-eating focussed foods includes panzerotti (large fried dumpling) and suppli [6]

**Mimi**

100% gluten free Neapolitan food, serving house made pasta. [6]

**Tasca Bio**

100% gluten free, informal pasta and pizza with outdoor seating. [2, 6]

**Gusto Italia 218 / Giacomo**

Though not a dedicated gluten free place, their gluten free pasta is house made and certified free
of cross contamination. [6]

**IDA**

"semi-gastronomic," trendy place. You can only order the Chef's menu, which seems to be excellent. [6]

**La Scuderia del Mulino**

Specialise in all things pizza. [6]

**Piccola Strada**

[6]

**Baffo**

Tuscan fine dining with a menu that shifts every three days.


## Not Italian

**Nous**

A chain of fun, fresh looking foods. [2]

**Soya cantine Bio**

As worthy as it sounds. [2]

# Ice cream

**Berthillon**

A famous café situated on one of the two islands in the middle of the Seine, serving gelato, pastries, cocktails and coffee late into the night. Their ice creams and sorbets do not contain any gluten ingredients, but the ice creams suffer from the dreaded "may contain traces" disclaimer. Sorbets are 100% safe though. They have two shops - one by the river that you can sit at, the other (a block away) is a wood-paneled tearoom.


**Grom**

Supposedly has gluten free cones. [5]

Note that all of these are out of date. Parisian restaurants drop like flies at the best of times,
and covid certainly didn't help. These are not in any order.
