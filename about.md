<img class="profile-picture" src="{{site.baseurl}}/{{site.profile-picture}}">

I'm a first year physics PhD student at the University of Cambridge. I study strongly-correlated
electrons and frustrated magnetism; materials in which conventional approximations about
independent electrons break down and more interesting quantum behaviour can manifest.

I also take an interest in high-voltage power electronics, web design and low-level programming.
