<img class="profile-picture" src="{{site.baseurl}}/{{site.profile-picture}}">

I'm a second year physics PhD student at the University of Cambridge. I study strongly-correlated
electrons and frustrated magnetism; materials in which conventional approximations about
independent electrons break down and more interesting quantum behaviour can manifest.

My current interest is in [Quantum Spin Ice]({{site.baseurl}}/2022-03-22-diamondrender/).

I also take an interest in high-voltage power electronics and web design.
